Punctuality and Meetings: Our team holds meetings twice a week: in person on Mondays at 2 PM and online via group call on Thursdays at 6 PM. Regular attendance from all members is essential to ensure the monitoring of our progress and maintain mutual understanding. 

Dedication and Time: We recognize that our project's success is contingent on each team member's dedication and commitment. Each member is expected to put some time aside and contribute to discussions and complete their assigned tasks to the best of their abilities. Additionally, meeting set deadlines for task completion is a shared expectation for all team members. 

Accountability and Support: As a team, we must hold ourselves accountable for the completion of tasks and offer support to our fellow members with any complications they may encounter during the project's execution.

Rewards: Team members who consistently demonstrate outstanding performance and adherence to our standards, going above and beyond, will receive recognition and rewards. These may include acknowledgment during team meetings, or other forms of recognition deemed appropriate. Recognizing and appreciating hard work can serve as motivation and inspiration for other team members, fostering a positive and productive work environment. 

Consequences: If team members fail to comply with our code of conduct, it may lead to disciplinary measures, such as reassignment of tasks, losing certain privileges, or, in serious situations, being removed from the team.
